# Whitelist for the linkchecker
#
# Empty lines and lines starting with '#' will be stripped out.
# If a link equals any other (even partial) line, it will not be checked.
# This enables us to simply write example.com to exclude all partial URL matches
# containing the given string. Keep in mind that http://libelektra.org/example.com
# would also match the example exclusion pattern.
#
# The following link only works if you are logged into the build server
