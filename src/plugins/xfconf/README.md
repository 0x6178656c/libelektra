## Introduction

This is a storage plugin to mount the xfconf configuration settings.

## Xfconf Terminology

### Property

A property in xfconf is the same as a key in libelektra i.e. it has a name and can hold one or more values.

### Channel

A channel is a type of namespace used in the xfconf library.
Usually, it is used to separate the properties of different applications which is helpful if different applications rely on a property with the same name but require them to hold different values.
For example Thunar uses a channel named `thunar`, Xfwm uses a channel named `xfwm4` and so on.
Keep in mind that channels are only used to separate the properties such as namespaces.
They are not a security feature i.e. every application has read/write access to every channel.

The list of all channels is stored in the `system:/elektra/modules/xfconf/channels` which is an array of all channel names.
Channel cannot be explicitly created or removed.
They only exist in an implicit manner when you pass the `channel=...` argument.

### Locks

Xfconf uses so-called locks to prevent users or applications to set properties to a new value.
They can be referred as a type of constant.
As of now, locks cannot be set or unset in xfconf which makes locked properties read-only forever.

## Dependencies

xfconf from the XFCE project

## Usage

The usage is identical to most storage plugins except that the channel option during mount must be defined in order to tell xfconf which channel to mount.

## Examples

```zsh
# Backup-and-Restore: user:/tests/xfconf

# mount the xfwm channel
kdb mount /dev/null /test/xfwm xfconf "channel=xfwm4" 2&>/dev/null

# store old button layout
set "OLD_LAYOUT=$(kdb get /test/xfwm/general/button_layout 2&>/dev/null)"

# set only a close button
kdb set system:/test/xfwm/general/button_layout "C|" 2&>/dev/null

# read the new layout
kdb get /test/xfwm/general/button_layout 2&>/dev/null
#> C|

# restore old layout
kdb set /test/xfwm/general/button_layout "$OLD_LAYOUT" 2&>/dev/null
```

## Limitations

- usage of a dummy file such as `/dev/null`
- xfconf locks can only be read but not set as this is not possible in xfconf
- comments and sorting are not implemented due the lack of both in xfconf
- due to memory leaks in xfconf upstream, valgrind reports errors when running the tests
