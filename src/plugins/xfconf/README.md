## Introduction

Copy this xfconf if you want to start a new
plugin written in C.

## Installation

See [installation](/doc/INSTALL.md).
The package is called `libelektra5-experimental`.

## Usage

You can use `scripts/copy-xfconf`
to automatically rename everything to your
plugin name:

- make sure `status`, `placements`, and other clauses conform to
  descriptions in `doc/CONTRACT.ini`

- add your plugin in `src/plugins/README.md`
- and rewrite the rest of this `README.md` to give a great
  explanation of what your plugin does
